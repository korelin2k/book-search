### Welcome to the Google Book Search!
![The App](doc/app.jpg "Join the Fun!")

### Try it out!

### Items I tried this time around
- Material-UI
- TypeScript - brought it back with this assignment (with React is added difficulty)
- Testing with Jest & MongoDB Memory "Server" for the backend
- Travis CI integration
- Coveralls integration for overall code coverage

### Lessons Learned (for next time)
- Need to move the majority of the validation and conditional logic outside of the jsx.
